# Reflection 

I feel like the ideas and concepts I plan to do with my project will cover most, if not all of the class objectives. If I'm being completely honest, I don't think I have 
been putting my best and honest effort into the in class activities and my studies. Given that I want to enhance my R and stats skills, it would be unfair for me to use
anything we have do in class (or lack of on my end) as a talking point as to what objectives I have covered so far with the class activities. However, I do have a plan of
how I believe my project will cover the objectives. 

Objectives : * Import, manage, and clean data.
                  * Nested bullet
                     * Sub-nested bullet etc
             * Bullet list item 2
