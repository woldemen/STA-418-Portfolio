# Reflection 

I feel like the ideas and concepts I plan to do with my project will cover most, if not all of the class objectives. If I'm being completely honest, I don't think I have 
been putting my best and honest effort into the in class activities and my studies. Given that I want to enhance my R and stats skills, it would be unfair for me to use
anything we have do in class (or lack of on my end) as a talking point as to what objectives I have covered so far with the class activities. However, I do have a plan of
how I believe my project will cover the objectives. 

1. Import, manage, and clean data.
  * I scraped my own data for this project. Even though other people have done sports and NBA project, mine is unique given that this data I have has never been used for
  * any data science projects. Cleaning this data before any analysis, and managing the data through the lifecyle of the entirety of the project will allow me to satify
  * this objective

2. Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations
  * One of the ideas I have is to analyze how the NBA has changed in the last 30 years (30 seasons was the amount of data I scraped) when it comes to 3-point shooting.
  * If you're an NBA player in today's game, you can not be on the floor unless you can shoot 3's. The idea of the traditional big centers that dominate the post no 
  * longer exist thanks to Stephen Curry and the Warriors. They've changed the league and basketball around the world. Everyone, including little kids want to shoot
  * from deep range. Half court shots or shots from the NBA logo are common now. I say all of this to say I want to graphically study/analyze this change. My main idea
  * for this part of my project is to use time series analysis, and other forms of graphs to see how shot attempts, shooting %'s have changed for the last couple 
  * decades in the NBA. I will also be doing clustering analysis to group the teams in my dataset together. I will do this by seasons, as well as wins for a given 
  * season. Furthermore, I want to look into correlations between the different variables in the dataset and wins. After doing so, I want to perform another clustering
  * analysis of the variables to see how they will be grouped together. I believe all of these ideas will be enough to satify this objective. 
 
 3. Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments
  * Another idea I will be exploring is doing a machine learning algorithm to predict the win/loss column for the upcoming season. I would like to run the
  * prediction(s) I get from this algorithm/algorithms through series of monte carlo simulation. I don't have a clear and concise idea of how I will be approaching the
  * simulation yet, maybe I will do a simulation before the algorithm and another simulation after the algorithm and do some comparsion. However, I think these 
  * simulations will be satifying this objective.
  
 4. Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs
  * Not sure what this objective is. From what I understand this objective wants us to use R documentation to debug and solve coding issues, if so then I should be
  * able to also cover this objective with my project because the codes I will have will be sophisticated enough that I will need to be doing plenty of troubleshooting
  * and debuging to get the results I expect.
  
 5. Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs
  * I plan on satifying this objective by writing code that is easy to follow and understand, I will also use comments throughout code cells to document what exactly
  * I'm doing with the code in those specific cells.
