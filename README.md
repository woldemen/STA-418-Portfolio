# STA-418-Portfolio
This repository will be a collection of everything I will be doing for STA 418 as it pertains to the class objectives. This collection will strictly have my work that satifies our class objectives.  

Table of Contents will be there. I'm unsure how to set the contents up. However, I will be looking at having hyper links to different work, such as my essay folder, grade reflection which will both be in this repo. Links to supporting artifcats and my class project will also be provided.
